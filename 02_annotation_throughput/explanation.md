# AI Annotation Project – Delay Risk Analysis

## Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates annotation throughput trends to identify
early signs of delivery risk before schedule delays occur.

## Business Question
Is annotation throughput stable over time, and can a sustained
decline in throughput be detected early enough to prevent
project-level delivery delays?

## Key Insight
A sustained decline in weekly throughput often precedes
project-level delivery delays.

## Management Implication
Monitoring throughput trends enables proactive staffing,
rebalancing, or vendor escalation before milestones are impacted.
