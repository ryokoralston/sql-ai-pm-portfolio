# AI Annotation Project – SLA Compliance Analysis

## Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates whether annotation tasks are being completed
within agreed SLA timelines and how SLA compliance impacts
overall project delivery performance.

## Business Question
Are annotation tasks completed within the agreed SLA timelines,
and does low SLA compliance increase the risk of project delays?

## Key Insight
Projects with lower SLA compliance rates tend to exhibit
higher delivery delay risk, indicating that task-level SLA
violations can accumulate into project-level schedule impact.

## Management Implication
Monitoring SLA compliance at the task level enables earlier
intervention, such as capacity rebalancing or vendor escalation,
before SLA breaches translate into missed delivery milestones.
