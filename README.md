# SQL Portfolio for AI Project Management

## Overview
This repository is a focused SQL portfolio for an AI Annotation Project Manager.

It demonstrates how SQL can be used by AI project managers to analyze
delivery risks, monitor annotation operations, and support data-driven
decision-making in large-scale AI annotation projects.

## Executive Summary
For a concise overview of how SQL is used to analyze delay risks in
AI annotation projects start with the Executive Summary below:

## How to Read This Portfolio (30-Second Guide)
This portfolio is designed to demonstrate how an AI Annotation Project Manager
uses SQL as a decision-support tool rather than a purely technical skill.

If you have limited time, start here:

1. **Delay Risk Analysis**  
   Understand how project-level delivery delays are identified and analyzed
   using schedule, quality, and rework signals.

2. **Annotation Throughput Analysis**  
   See how throughput trends are used as early warning indicators before
   delivery milestones are impacted.

3. **SLA Compliance Analysis**  
   Review how task-level SLA adherence is monitored and how SLA violations
   accumulate into project-level delivery risk.

4. **Quality Drift Analysis**  
   Learn how changes and instability in quality issue trends can signal
   annotation guideline drift or operational risk before model quality degrades.

Each case includes a clear business question, SQL-based analysis,
and management implications to illustrate a practical AI project
management decision-making.

## Focus Areas
- Delay risk analysis in AI annotation projects
- Vendor and annotation-type performance comparison
- Rework and quality issue monitoring as early risk indicators
- Translating operational data into actionable management insights

## Target Audience
- AI Annotation Project Managers
- Technical Program Managers working with AI/ML pipelines
- Data-driven PMs collaborating with engineering and operations teams

## Notes
All data used in this repository is synthetic and created solely for
demonstration and portfolio purposes.
