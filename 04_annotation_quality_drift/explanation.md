# AI Annotation Project – Quality Drift Analysis

## Executive Summary
This analysis examines quality issue trends over time to detect
early signs of operational instability or annotation guideline drift
in AI annotation projects.

## Business Question
Are quality issues becoming more frequent or unstable over time,
indicating potential annotation guideline drift or operational risk?

## Analytical Approach
Quality issue data was analyzed on a weekly basis to identify
volume changes, unresolved issue accumulation, and sudden increases
that may signal process instability.

## Key Insight
A noticeable increase or fluctuation in weekly quality issues
often precedes broader delivery and quality risks, even when
overall project timelines initially appear stable.

## Management Implication
By monitoring quality drift signals early, project managers can
intervene through guideline clarification, targeted retraining,
or process adjustments before issues escalate into delivery delays
or model quality degradation.
